      "content"  : "The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issues a Request for Evidence (RFE) when additional information or documentation is needed to make a decision on an immigration application. When an applicant submits a petition or application, USCIS reviews the provided materials. If the adjudicating officer determines that certain information is missing, unclear, or insufficient to make a decision, they will issue an RFE.The RFE will specify the additional evidence or information required and provide a deadline for the applicant to respond. It is essential for the applicant to address the requests in a thorough and timely manner to avoid delays or potential denials of their immigration application.Typically, the RFE will outline the specific issues or concerns, and the applicant must submit the requested documentation or clarification to support their case. This process is a standard part of the immigration application review, and responding appropriately to an RFE is crucial for a successful application outcome.Table of Content  Most Common RFE for Adjustment of Status          Incomplete Documentation      Insufficient Supporting Evidence      Credential Evaluation      Proof of Eligibility      Proof of Relationship      Employment-Based Cases      Affidavits and Letters of Support      Medical Examination        Responding to a USCIS Request for Evidence (RFE)          Review the RFE      Create a Checklist      Understand the Deadline      Prepare a Cover Letter      Compile Supporting Documents      Address Each Point      Professional Language      Consult an Immigration Attorney      Send Via Certified Mail      Keep a Copy        How to avoid RFE          Thoroughly Understand Requirements      Complete and Accurate Forms      Organize Supporting Documents      Follow USCIS Instructions      Provide Translations      Use Updated Forms      Check for Updates and Policy Changes      Seek Legal Advice      Include a Cover Letter      Maintain Consistency        What is A Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID)?          Reasons for Intent to Deny      Response Required      Provide Adequate Documentation      Legal Assistance      Most Common RFE for Adjustment of StatusThe Request for Evidence (RFE) issued by the USCIS can vary depending on the type of immigration application or petition. However, some common themes or reasons for RFEIncomplete Documentation  If the initial submission lacks necessary documents or contains incomplete information, USCIS may issue an RFE requesting the missing items.Insufficient Supporting Evidence  USCIS may ask for additional evidence to support the claims made in the application. This can include proof of relationships, employment history, financial support, etc.Credential Evaluation  For educational or professional credentials obtained outside the United States, USCIS might request an evaluation from a recognized credential evaluation service to determine the equivalence of foreign degrees or qualifications.Proof of Eligibility  Applicants may be asked to provide additional proof of eligibility, particularly when it comes to demonstrating qualifications for specific visa categories.Proof of Relationship  In family-based immigration cases, USCIS may seek additional evidence to establish the bona fide nature of relationships, such as marriage certificates, birth certificates, or other relevant documents.Employment-Based Cases  In cases where the applicant is sponsored for employment, USCIS might issue an RFE seeking more information about the job offer, the employer, or the beneficiary’s qualifications.Affidavits and Letters of Support  USCIS may request additional affidavits or letters of support to corroborate information provided in the application.Medical Examination  If an applicant is required to undergo a medical examination as part of the immigration process, USCIS may issue an RFE if the medical report is missing or incomplete.It’s important for applicants to carefully review the RFE, understand the specific requests, and provide a comprehensive and timely response. Seeking guidance from an immigration attorney can be beneficial in addressing RFEs effectively. Keep in mind that the nature of RFEs can vary based on the specific immigration category and individual circumstances.Responding to a USCIS Request for Evidence (RFE)Review the RFE  Carefully read the entire RFE notice to understand the specific issues or information that USCIS is requesting. Make note of the documents or evidence needed.Create a Checklist  Organize the requested documents and information into a checklist. Ensure that you gather all necessary items before preparing your response.Understand the Deadline  Take note of the deadline mentioned in the RFE notice. It’s crucial to submit your response before the specified date to avoid delays or potential denials.Prepare a Cover Letter  Write a cover letter that clearly addresses each point raised in the RFE. Use the cover letter to provide explanations, clarifications, and additional information requested.Compile Supporting Documents  Gather all the necessary documents and evidence requested in the RFE. Make sure the documents are legible, organized, and clearly labeled. Include photocopies rather than original documents.Address Each Point  Respond to each specific point raised in the RFE thoroughly and directly. Clearly explain and provide evidence to support your case. If certain information is not applicable, provide a concise explanation.Professional Language  Use professional and respectful language in your response. Clearly communicate your case without unnecessary elaboration.Consult an Immigration Attorney  If you find the RFE confusing or if you’re unsure about how to address certain issues, consider seeking the guidance of an immigration attorney. They can provide valuable insights and ensure that your response meets USCIS requirements.Send Via Certified Mail  When submitting your response, send it using a traceable and reliable method, such as certified mail with return receipt requested. This helps you track the delivery and provides proof that USCIS received your response.Keep a Copy  Make copies of your entire response, including the cover letter and all supporting documents, for your records. This is important for your reference and in case there are any future inquiries.Remember, the key is to be thorough, accurate, and timely in your response. If you have any doubts or concerns, consulting with an immigration attorney can significantly improve the quality of your response and increase the chances of a favorable outcome.How to avoid RFEWhile it’s not possible to guarantee that an application will never receive a Request for Evidence (RFE) from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), there are steps you can take to minimize the likelihood of receiving one. Here are some tips to help avoid RFEs:Thoroughly Understand Requirements  Before submitting your application, carefully review the USCIS guidelines and requirements for the specific immigration benefit you are seeking. Ensure that you meet all eligibility criteria and provide all necessary documentation.Complete and Accurate Forms  Fill out all application forms accurately and completely. Double-check your answers and ensure that there are no errors or omissions.Organize Supporting Documents  Submit well-organized and legible supporting documents. Clearly label each document and arrange them in a logical order. Providing a table of contents can make it easier for USCIS officers to navigate through your submission.Follow USCIS Instructions  Adhere to the USCIS instructions provided for each form and application. Failure to follow instructions may result in an RFE.Provide Translations  If any of your supporting documents are not in English, provide accurate and certified translations. USCIS requires translations for documents in languages other than English.Use Updated Forms  Make sure you are using the most recent versions of USCIS forms. Outdated forms may result in processing delays or an RFE.Check for Updates and Policy Changes  Stay informed about any changes in immigration laws, policies, or procedures. USCIS may issue updates or changes in requirements that could affect your application.Seek Legal Advice  If you have any concerns about the application process or if your case is particularly complex, consider consulting with an immigration attorney. They can provide guidance on preparing a strong and complete application.Include a Cover Letter  Submit a well-written cover letter that provides a clear overview of your case. This can help USCIS officers understand the purpose of your application and navigate through the supporting documents.Maintain Consistency  Ensure consistency in the information provided across different forms and supporting documents. Inconsistencies may raise questions and lead to an RFE.While these tips can help reduce the likelihood of an RFE, it’s important to note that some cases may still receive requests for additional evidence.What is A Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID)?A Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) is a communication from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) indicating the agency’s intention to deny an immigration application or petition. It is issued when the USCIS officer reviewing the application believes that there is insufficient evidence or legal basis to approve the application as submitted.The NOID typically outlines the specific reasons for the potential denial and provides the applicant with an opportunity to address those concerns. It may request additional evidence, clarification, or legal arguments to support the application. The notice will specify a deadline by which the applicant must respond.Key points about the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID):Reasons for Intent to Deny  The NOID will clearly state the reasons why the USCIS is considering a denial. This could be due to issues such as lack of evidence, eligibility concerns, or failure to meet specific legal requirements.Response Required  The applicant must respond to the NOID within the specified timeframe. Failure to respond or inadequate responses may result in the denial of the application.Provide Adequate Documentation  When responding to a NOID, it is crucial to address each concern raised by the USCIS and provide additional documentation or clarification to overcome the stated grounds for potential denial.Legal Assistance  If the issues raised in the NOID are complex or if you are uncertain about how to address them, seeking the advice of an immigration attorney can be beneficial. An attorney can help formulate a strong response and navigate the legal aspects of the process.It’s important for applicants to take NOIDs seriously and respond comprehensively within the given timeframe. If the issues raised in the NOID are adequately addressed, the USCIS may reconsider and approve the application. However, if no response is submitted or if the response is insufficient, the application is likely to be denied."

Immigrant visa number is provided for the Green Card. USCIS gives only a certain number of Green Cards every year. If a Green Card application is approved, it is not guaranteed that a visa number will be allocated. This is the reason there is a backlog for Green Cards. People from countries like India wait for more than 10 years to get their Green Card in the employment-based category. Family-based immigrant visa numbers are easy to get as availability is higher compared to employment-based category.What is Nonimmigrant Visa Number?USCIS issues nonimmigrant visas for foreign nationals who are visiting the US for a short duration, example: work, study, tourism. It is granted only for a temporary stay in the US."

      "content"  : "Form I-485, officially known as the “Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status,” is a document used in the United States immigration process. This form is filed by individuals who are seeking to become lawful permanent residents of the United States, which is commonly referred to as obtaining a green card.The I-485 application is typically submitted by individuals who are already present in the United States on a qualifying nonimmigrant visa, such as a fiance visa (K-1), student visa (F-1), or work visa (H-1B), and wish to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident. It is also used by certain family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents and individuals with approved asylum or refugee status who are eligible to apply for adjustment of status.The I-485 application is a comprehensive form that collects information about the applicant’s background, immigration history, and eligibility for permanent residency. It requires supporting documentation, such as proof of identity, photographs, and other evidence to establish eligibility.Once the I-485 application is filed and the necessary biometrics are taken, applicants may be called for an interview at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office. The interview allows USCIS to verify the information provided in the application and assess the applicant’s eligibility for permanent residency.It’s important to note that immigration policies and procedures can change, so it’s advisable to check the USCIS website or consult with an immigration attorney for the most up-to-date information regarding the I-485 application process.Table of Content  EB2 to EB3 Interfiling          EB-2 and EB-3 Categories      Process      Considerations      I-485 Interfiling Guide      EB3 to EB2 Interfiling Cover Letters      EB2 to EB3 InterfilingInterfiling from EB-2 (Employment-Based Second Preference) to EB-3 (Employment-Based Third Preference) refers to the practice of changing the classification of a pending employment-based immigrant petition. Both EB-2 and EB-3 are employment-based immigrant visa categories in the United States.In certain situations, an individual with an approved or pending EB-2 petition may consider interfiling to the EB-3 category.Here’s a general overview of the concepts involved:EB-2 and EB-3 Categories  EB-2: This category is for individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities in their field. It includes professionals holding advanced degrees (beyond a bachelor’s degree) or individuals with exceptional abilities in the arts, sciences, or business.  EB-3: This category is for skilled workers, professionals with bachelor’s degrees, and other workers with less than two years of experience.Process  To request an interfiling, applicants typically submit a written request to USCIS along with supporting documentation.  The request should include a cover letter explaining the request for interfiling, any changes in circumstances or qualifications, and any additional supporting evidence.Considerations  Interfiling may depend on the availability of visa numbers in the EB-3 category and other factors.  USCIS may evaluate the case to ensure it meets the requirements of the requested category.It’s crucial to note that immigration policies and procedures can change, so applicants should consult with an immigration attorney or check the latest guidance on the USCIS website for the most up-to-date information and instructions regarding interfiling between employment-based immigrant visa categories. Each case is unique, and the success of an interfiling request may depend on specific circumstances and eligibility criteria.I-485 Interfiling GuideYou can interfile from EB3 to EB2 if your priority date is current.I-485 Interfiling GuideEB3 to EB2 Interfiling Cover LettersGenerate EB3 to EB2 Interfiling Cover Letter with Barcodes.EB3 to EB2 Interfiling Single Cover Letter for FamilyEB3 to EB2 Interfiling Cover Letter for Individual Applicant"

It is typically done by filing Form I-485, the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.EAD - Employment Authorization DocumentAn Employment Authorization Document is a work permit that allows individuals in the U.S. who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents to work legally. As part of the AOS process, applicants may file Form I-765 to request an EAD, enabling them to work while their green card application is pending.AP - Advance ParoleAdvance Parole is a travel document that allows individuals with pending AOS applications to travel outside the United States and return without abandoning their AOS application. It is filed using Form I-131.In the context of the AOS process, individuals often apply for both an EAD and Advance Parole simultaneously, often referred to as a “combo card” because it includes both the work authorization and travel permission. This combo card allows individuals to work in the U.S. and travel abroad while their green card application is pending.In summary, AOS (Adjustment of Status) is the overall process of becoming a permanent resident, EAD (Employment Authorization Document) allows for legal work while the AOS application is pending, and AP (Advance Parole) permits travel outside the U.S. without abandoning the AOS application. The combination of EAD and AP on a single card is often convenient for individuals going through the AOS process.AOS EAD/AP RenewalProcess to renew AOS EAD/AP.EAD/AP Combo card Renewal ProcessOnly AP Renewal ProcessOnly EAD Renewal ProcessEAD/AP Renewal Cover LettersGenerate EAD/AP Renewal cover letter with barcodes.EAD/AP Combo CardEAD/AP Combo Card Renewal Single Cover Letter for FamilyEAD/AP Combo Card Renewal Cover Letter for Individual ApplicantEAD Card OnlyEAD Renewal Single Cover Letter for FamilyEAD Renewal Cover Letter for Individual ApplicantAP Card OnlyAP Renewal Single Cover Letter for FamilyAP Renewal Cover Letter for Individual Applicant"
